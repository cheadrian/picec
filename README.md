# Control your Raspberry Pi with your TV remote

![picec](/resources/picec.gif)

This little script will allow you to control your Raspberry Pi using the buttons in your regular TV remote.

You can press the following buttons on the remote.

    OK       – launch kodi
    up       – launch browser
    down     – change wallpaper (this is a custom script of mine)
    left     – suspend your desktop computer
    back     – halt Raspberry Pi
    stop     – enter “mouse mode”, to move the mouse with the arrows. OK to double click
    play     – exit “mouse mode”

These bindings are set as an example. Each person should change them to suit their own needs.
